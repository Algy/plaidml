   :alt: Build Status

PlaidML is an advanced and portable tensor compiler for enabling deep learning 
on laptops, embedded devices, or other kinds of workstations where compute may be 
limited.

As a component within the `nGraph Compiler stack`_, PlaidML further extends the 
capabilities of specialized deep-learning hardware (especially GPUs,) and makes 
it both easier and faster to access or make use of subgraph-level optimizations 
that would otherwise be bounded by the compute limitations of the device. The 
latest version of PlaidML includes initial support for **PlaidML**'s ``Stripe``, 
written in the :doc:`Tile <tile/about>` language. Tile was specifically created 
to be able to overcome the many limitations of fussy, brittle and tightly-coupled 
GPU-based software architectures. By bridging the gap between the universal 
mathematical descriptions of deep learning operations, such as convolution, and 
the platform and chip-specific operations that enable acceleration, PlaidML makes 
deep learning work everywhere.

As a component under `Keras`_ PlaidML can accelerate training workloads with 
customized or automatically-generated Tile code. It works especially well on 
GPUs, and it doesn't require use of CUDA/cuDNN on Nvidia* hardware, while 
achieving comparable performance.

It works on all major operating systems: Linux, `macOS`_, and `Windows`_. 

For background and early benchmarks, see our `blog post`_.

PlaidML is under active development and should be thought of as alpha quality.
