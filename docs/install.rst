Installation Instructions
########################## 

PlaidML supports Ubuntu\* Linux, macOS\* and Microsoft Windows\* operating 
systems. 

* :ref:`ubuntu-linux`
* :ref:`macos`
* :ref:`windows` 


.. _ubuntu-linux: 

Ubuntu Linux
============

If necessary, install Python's '``pip`` tool. OpenCL is also required. 

.. code-block:: console

   sudo add-apt-repository universe && sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3-pip
   sudo apt install clinfo

Run ``clinfo``, and if it reports ``"Number of platforms" == 0``, you 
can install a driver (GPU) or enable a CPU via one of these options: 

* **Nvidia** -- For Nvidia GPUs, run:

  .. code-block:: console
   
     sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa && sudo apt update
     sudo apt install nvidia-modprobe nvidia-384 nvidia-opencl-icd-384 libcuda1-384

* **AMD** -- For AMD graphics cards, `download the AMDGPU PRO driver`_ and follow 
  the instructions provided by AMD for the chip.

* **Intel® Xeon® Processors OR Intel® Core™ Processors** -- In lieu of installing 
  specific drivers, you can `install nGraph with pip`_, or you can 
  `build the nGraph Library`_ with the cmake flag ```-DNGRAPH_PLAIDML_ENABLE=TRUE``.
  

Python
------

Although PlaidML can be run with Python2, we recommend Python3, as well as 
judicious use of a `Virtualenv`_.  To create one just for using PlaidML:

.. code-block:: console
   
   python3 -m venv plaidml-venv
   source plaidml-venv/bin/activate

Keras
-----

There are two ways to get Keras working on your system:  

#. Isolate it to your `venv` as follows: 

   .. code-block:: console 

      pip install -U plaidml-keras

#. Alternatively, install the PlaidML wheels system-wide with:
   
   .. code-block:: console 

      sudo -H pip install -U plaidml-keras

Finally, set up PlaidML to use a preferred computing device:

.. code-block:: console 

   plaidml-setup

You can test the installation by running MobileNet in `plaidbench`_. Remember to 
use ``sudo -H`` if you're working outside of a virtual environment. 

.. code-block:: console

   pip install plaidml-keras plaidbench
   plaidbench keras mobilenet

You can adapt any Keras code by using the PlaidML backend instead of the 
TensorFlow\*, CNTK\*, or Theano\* backend that you'd normally use; simply change 
the Keras backend to ``plaidml.keras.backend``. You can do this by modifying 
``~/.keras/keras.json`` so that the backend line reads ``"backend": "plaidml.keras.backend"`` 
If this file does not exist, see the `Backend instructions for Keras`_. If you 
don't need anything special in your keras settings, you can set the 
``~/.keras/keras.json`` as follows:

.. code-block:: json 

   {
       "epsilon": 1e-07,
       "floatx": "float32",
       "image_data_format": "channels_last",
       "backend": "plaidml.keras.backend"
    }


Another option is to globally set the ``KERAS_BACKEND`` environment variable 
to :envvar:`plaidml.keras.backend`.

A monkey-patch technique involving ``plaidml.keras.install_backend()`` may still 
work, but should be considered deprecated in favor of the above methods.


.. _macos: 

macOS
=====

A computer listed on `Apple's compatibility list`_ with support for OpenCL 1.2 
is required; those from 2011 and later usually fit this requirement.  

Python 
------

Although PlaidML can be run with Python2, we recommend Python3, as well as 
judicious use of a `Virtualenv`_.  To create one just for using PlaidML:

.. code-block:: console
   
   python3 -m venv plaidml-venv
   source plaidml-venv/bin/activate

Keras
-----

To install PlaidML with Keras, run the following: 

.. code-block:: console

   pip install -U plaidml-keras


Finally, set up PlaidML to use a preferred computing device:

.. code-block:: console 

   plaidml-setup

PlaidML should now be installed! You can test the installation by running 
MobileNet in `plaidbench`_. 

.. code-block:: console

   pip install plaidml-keras plaidbench
   plaidbench keras mobilenet


.. _windows: 

Windows
=======

These instructions assume Windows 10 without Python installed; adapt accordingly. 

#. First install :command:`Chocolatey` by starting an Administrator PowerShell 
   and running:

   .. code-block:: console 

      Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

#. You'll likely need to reboot your shell at this point. 

#. Install Python:

   .. code-block:: console

      choco install -y python git vcredist2015

#. Switch to an unprivileged PowerShell to install and set up PlaidML with 
   Keras

   .. code-block:: console

      pip install -U plaidml-keras
      plaidml-setup

PlaidML should now be installed! You can test the installation by running 
MobileNet in `plaidbench`_. 

.. code-block:: console

   pip install plaidml-keras plaidbench
   plaidbench keras mobilenet
